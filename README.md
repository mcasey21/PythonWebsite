I seen a video about streamlit one day and decided to have a crack at it

This repo contains; the entrypoint file, euclids algorithm file, robbin data test fileand then the json where data is sent

I decided to make the euclids algo in python as we were covering it in maths and I wanted to host it so people in my class
could use it. So between that and wanted to try streamlit it was a perfect overlap

the robbing data page is just a simple simulation on how easy data can be robbed by big companies, I wanted to prove to my 
friend how easy it was. I used stremlits features to get the data and then used TINYDB the python package to write the data
to the json file

F.Y.I -> euclids algorithm is a maths technique or formula to find the greatest common divisior (gcd) of 2 numbers
